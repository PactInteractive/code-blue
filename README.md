## Local development
1. First, install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Or alternatively - only run the build once:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
3. Open the extension list in your browser settings: [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
4. Enable **Developer mode**
5. Click the **Load unpacked** button, navigate to the extension root folder and pick the `build` folder
6. Enjoy!
